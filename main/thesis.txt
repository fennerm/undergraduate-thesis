Introduction



Mitochondrial               Evolutionary               History

The  advent  of modern    molecular   classiﬁcation   techniques   has complicated    the notion
of the three  clearly  dilineated  domains    of life, Archaea,   Bacteria  and   Eukarya.   The
pre-genetic  Darwinian    model   of speciation   can  be represented   as a tree  with  lineages
represented   by  branches   evolving  and   diverging   in isolation.  Numerous    examples   of
transfer  of genetic  material   between   divergent    lineages have  now   been  documented,
suggesting   that the  tree  metaphor    is an inadaquate    representation.    Horizontal  gene
transfer  (HGT)    is ubiquitous    in  bacteria  and   archaea   and   may   be  the  dominant
driver of genetic  diversity  (?)  HGT    is rare in  multicellular eukaryotes   but  horizontal
transfer of transposable    elements   may   play an   important  role  in eukaryotic  evolution
(?). Additionally,   phylogenetic    analysis  has  shown   that  a signiﬁcant   fraction  of the
mammalian     genome   is of viral origin  due  to retroviral  integration  events  (?). In light
of this evidence  we  should  not  solely view  the  genome   as the product   of diversiﬁcation
within  a single  lineage  but  instead   as a  chimera   of genetic  material   from  divergent
lineages.
    The  origin  of mitochondria    represents   an  important   example   of genetic  exchange
in the  eukaryotic   lineage.   Mitochondria     are  a  type  of membrane     bound   organelle
found   in eukaryotic   cells  which,  like  plastids   and  peroxisomes,    carry  out  integral
metabolic   processes  for  their  hosts.  The   discovery   that  mitochondria    possess  their
own  genome    isolated from   the nuclear   genome    provided  the  ﬁrst strong  indication  of
their separate  origin (?).  Later  sequence   analysis   showed  that  genes  in the mitochon-
drial genome    and  nuclear   genes  involved   in mitochondrial    function   are homologous
to α-proteobacteria    while   the rest  of the  nuclear  genome    is archaeal  in origin  (??).
This  suggests  that  the  membrane     bound   nucleus,   the deﬁning   feature  of eukaryotes,
evolved  in the  archaeal  lineage.  Later   this proto-eukaryote    internalized  the  bacterial
progenitor   to mitochondria.     The   internalized   bacteria  are thought   to  have  become
endosymbionts     which   freely replicated   inside  their host  and  while  provided   it some

selective advantage.     This  bacteria   would   have   originally possessed   a large  genome
which  approximated     its host  in complexity.    Eventually   due  to relaxation  of selective
pressure,  genes  required   for  free living  were  lost  or transferred  to the  host  genome
in a process   called  endosymbiontic     gene   transfer  (?).  The  precise  evolutionary    ex-
planation   for how  and  why   the  mitochondrial    progenitor   ﬁrst entered  its host  is still
debated   with  both  phagocytic    and  symbiotic   hypotheses    proposed.

Phagocytic      Origin
The  earliest formulation   of endosymbiontic     theory  proposed   that mitochondria    are  de-
rived from   bacteria  which   were  phagocytosed     but  not digested  by an  early  eukaryote
(Figure  ??A)   (?). Later  supporters    of this hypothesis   have  argued  that  the evolution
of the nucleus  in eukaryotes    is a key  enabling   factor for phagotrophy    (?) Modern     eu-
karyotic  phagotrophs    digest  cells in  their cytoplasm    and  make  extensive   use of their
cytoskeletal  architecture   to  pursue   and  internalize   prey.  Phylogenetic   analysis  sug-
gests that  the  ﬁrst  eukaryote    was  almost   certainly  phagotrophic    (?).  However    this
does  not negate   the possibility   that  phagotrophy    evolved   in the archaeal  ancestor   of
eukaryotes   before the  evolution   of the nucleus.   Phagocytic   explanations   for the origin
of mitochondria    predict  that  the  evolution  of the  nucleus  predates  the  mitochondria.
If the nucleus   evolved  ﬁrst  it is plausible  that  certain  eukaryotic   lineages  might   ex-
ist which  contain  a  nucleus   but  do  not  have  any  mitochondria    or related  organelles.
Until recently  a  class of unicellular   eukaryotes   named   Archezoa   were  thought   to lack
mitochondria    (?). Archezoa    consisted   of unicellular  eukaryotes  such  as microsporidia
and  diplomonads    and  were  thought    to represent  an  intermediate  link between   eukary-
otes and   archaea.   However    these   organisms   were   later shown   to contain   organelles
derived  from  mitochondria    but   which  had  lost their genome    (??) Since  then  no  inter-
mediate   links have  been   found   and  mitochondria     are now   thought  to  be  ubiquitous
in eukaryotes.

Symbiotic     Origin

A  second  class of theories  suggest   that  mitochondria    were  acquired  from   a symbiotic
relationship  between   archaeal    and  bacterial  cells (Figure  ??B).  Under   the  hydrogen
hypothesis,   the most   well supported    of these  theories,  the nucleus  and  mitochondria
were  introduced   in the  same   event   (?). First  a methane    producing   archaeon   associ-
ated  extracellularly  with   one  or  more  α-proteobacteria     capable  of both  aerobic   and
anaerobic   metabolism.     In  anaerobic   conditions    the bacteria  produce   hydrogen    gas


Introduction                                                                                     3

and  carbon   dioxide   as waste   products   which   are  digested   by  the  archaeon.   Even-
tually the  archaeon    internalizes  the bacterium    via  an undescribed     mechanism.    One
testable prediction   of  the hydrogen    hypothesis   is that the  archaeal   progenitor  of  eu-
karyotes  should   be  a  methanogen.      Extensive    HGT    among    archaeal   and  bacterial
lineages makes   this  diﬃcult   to  test in practice  however    since  the  existence  of genes
within  a lineage does   not  deﬁnitely  prove  anything   (?).  Also  predicts  that  mitochon-
drial progenitor   should   have  genes   for both  aerobic   and  anaerobic    conditions.   also
complicated   by  HGT.    Hydrogenosomes      support   this hypothesis.





Present    Diversity

Mitochondria    are  now   thought    to be  ubiquitous    in eukaryotes.     Regardless   of the
precise timeline,  the   introduction   of  mitochondria    into  eukaryotic   cells occurred   at
an extremely    early  period   in eukaryotic   diversiﬁcation.    Accordingly,    mitochondria
express  considerable    functional  and   genetic  diversity  among    eukaryotes.   Mitochon-
dria can be  broadly   separated   into three  classes found  in diﬀerent   eukaryotic  lineages:
classical mitochondria,    hydrogenosomes      and  mitosomes     (?)  Despite  their  widely  di-
vergent  function  it is now  commonly     accepted  that  they  are all derived  from  the same
endosymbiontic    event   (??).  Classical  mitochondria    are  found   in animals,  plants  and
many   unicellular  eukaryotes.     They   are  primarily  involved   in  ATP    production   but
also play  important    roles in  apoptosis   and  regulation   of membrane     potentials.   De-
spite the imprecise    terminology,   it is important    to note  that   classical mitochondria
are not  necessarily   more   similar to  the  common     mitochondrial    ancestor   than  other
classes. Hydrogenosomes       are  found   in parabasalids   and   anaerobic   ciliates and  pro-
duce  ATP   like classical  mitochondria    but  rely on  fermentation    rather  than  the citric
acid cycle  (?).  Mitosomes     are  found  in  diplomonads    completely    lack  ATP   produc-
tion, instead their  only  role appears  to  be in the production    of iron-sulfur  clusters (?).
Intermediate   organelles   exist (Mitochondrion-like     organelles).   In general  only  classi-
cal mitochondria    have   their own   genome   but  exceptions    exist. Some   taxa   contain  a
combination   of multiple   classes.  Only   role in common    is in Fe-S   assembly.

Animal          Mitochondrial                 Function

Oxidative     Phosphorylation

ATP   synthesis  via  oxidative   phosphorylation     is the  most   important    role  of mitochon-
dria in  animal  cells.  Energy    sources   come  in  a variety   of sources,   metabolism      is the
conversion   of these  into  energy   which   can  be  used   readily  in  a number     of  processes.
adenosine   triphosphate    (ATP)     is the energy   source   used   for the  majority    of  cellular
work.  The   mitochondria     is the  terminal  node   in the  progressive    metabolism     of nutri-
ents into  ATP,   the  universal    energy  source.   Major    source   of ATP    in  animal   cells  is
from  the  electron transfer   chain  which   occurs  at the  mitochondrial     membrane      through
a series of electron   donors   and  acceptors   utilizing  redox   chemistry.    ATP    is produced
from  adenosine   diphosphate     (ADP)    via  the addition   of  a phosphate    group.    Electrons
are passed   to progressively   more   electronegative   compounds      which   each  time   produces
free energy.   This  energy   is used   to pump    protons   from   the  mitochondrial      matrix   to
the intermembrane      space   (see  ﬁg)  creating  an  electrochemical     proton   gradient.    This
creates  potential  energy   which    is used  by ATP     synthase   to  produce    ATP.    ATP   syn-
thase  if often compared     to  a turbine   in which   the  ﬂow   of protons   causes   the  enzyme
to spin  and  consecutively    phosphorylate     ADP.    This  entire  process   is called   oxidative
phosphorylation     (OXPHOS)       or mitochondrial     respiration.
    Electron   carriers  - coenzyme     Q  (ubiquinone)     and   cytochrome     c.  The    OXPHOS
pathway    produces   ATP   from    ADP   and   phosphate    (P  ) with  NADH      and   succinate   as
                                                                i

are the  output  of  the citric  acid  cycle, fatty acid   oxidation   and  amino    acid  oxidation.
Mitochondrial    respiration   fully oxidizes  nutrients   to H   0, CO   , NH    which    are readily

oxidoreductase),    NADH     is oxidized  to NAD     is coupled   to  the reduction    of ubiquinone
to ubiquinol   (?). Complex      II (succinate:ubiquinone      reductase)   is also  part   of the cit-
ric acid  cycle, and  couples   the  oxidation   of succinate   to  fumarate    with   the  reduction
of ubiquinone    to  ubinquinol.     Complex    II does   not  contribute     to the   proton   gradi-
ent and   hence   only  acts  as  a  source   of ubiquinol    (?).  The   ubiquinol     produced     by
complexes    I and  II, as  well  as  by  glycerolphosphate     dehydrogenase      and    acylCoAFp

Mitochondrial                Genetics

Mitochondrial        DNA

Mitochondrial     DNA    (mtDNA)      is a  16  kb  circular   double   stranded   genome    which
contains   only  about   x  genes.   MtDNA      is present   in  multiple  copy   inside  the  cell.
The  number     of mtDNA     within  a cell ranges   from  x1-x2,   with considerable    intra and
interspeciﬁc   variability  as well  as variability  from   cell-cell within  an  organism.   Also
tissue variance.   The  mtDNA      are housed   inside individual   mitochondria    - x copies  per
cell and  the  number    of mtDNA     also  varies between    mitochondria.     We  can  therefore
examine    mtDNA     at a  large  number    of population    genetic  levels: the   mitochondria,
the cell, the  tissue, the organism   and  the  organismal    population.   Fusion   and  ﬁssion of
mitochondria     mean   that  individual   mitochondrial    genotypes    are not   isolated within
mitochondria.     MtDNA     is maternally   inherited in  the vast  majority  of  eukaryotes  with
oﬀspring   getting  their mtDNA      genotype   from  their  mother.
    Among    animals   the gene   content  of mtDNA     is remarkably   conserved.    MtDNA     are
typically   16  kb  long  with  37  conserved   genes.   Of  these  genes,  13  code  for proteins
involved   in the  OXPHOS      system,   2 are  rRNAs    and  22  are  tRNAs.    The   tRNAs   and
rRNAs    are  involved   speciﬁcally   the  translation   of mitochondrial     proteins.   Animal
mtDNA      typically  contains   37  conserved    genes  which    are  transcribed   continuously
into polycistronic   molecules   which  are  cleaved  (Figure).   Additionally   mtDNA     contain
an  approximately     1  kb  untranscribed     regulatory   region   named   the   control  region.

The  genes   found  in mtDNA      represent  a  very  small  subset   of the  approximately    1000
genes  which   have   been  found   to be  contained    in  mitochondria     (?)  A  large  number
of mitochondrial     genes  are  also found    in nuclear   genome     and  are  later targeted   to
mitochondria.     The  majority   of these   genes   are thought    to have   originally been  part
of the  mtDNA      genome    but  were  later  transferred    in  to mitochondria     in a  process
called  endosymbiontic     gene  transfer.   Unlike   the  eukaryotic   nuclear   genome   but  like
bacterial  genomes    mtDNA     is almost   entirely  coding.    Due   to its small  genome   size  -
was among    the  ﬁrst to be sequenced    and  is frequently   used  in constructing   phylogenies
due  to its conserved    gene  set and  multiple    copies  per  cell. It is clear that  due  to  its
unique   mode   of inheritance   and  multiple    copy  per  cell, our  models   for the  evolution
of the  nuclear  genome    do  not  necessarily   apply   to mtDNA      and   diﬀerent  models   are
required.   mtDNA     frequently   used for  phylogenetic    analysis.


Mutation      Rate
Mitochondrial    mutation    rate  varies considerably     in eukaryotes.    Historically  the  mu-
tation  rate  in  eukaryotic   mtDNA      was  thought    to  be   very  low.   However    as  more
mutation    rates  have  been   calculated   it has  been   found   that  this  result was   due  to
most   studies  being   done   in plants   (?).   It is  now   known    that  mutation    rates  are
lower  than  the  nuclear  mutation   rate  in plants   but  that  in animals   the mitochondrial
mutation    rate is considerably    higher  than   the  nuclear.    However    mutation   rates  are
extremely   variable   and  exceptions  to  the  rule  have  been   seen  in both  plants  and  ani-
mals  (see Sloan   and  Taylor).  This  is consistent   with  the  emerging    view that  mutation
rate is a trait like  other traits  and  is under   the forces  of drift  and  selection like other
traits with   phenotypic    eﬀects.  Since   mutation    is the  ultimate    cause  of any  genetic
variation,  these  diﬀerences   in  mutation    rates  likely themselves    stem   from  mutation.
Considerable    debate   exists about  the  cause   of these  diﬀerences    in mutation   rate with
both  mechanistic    and   selective hypothesis    being   put  forward.    This  increased   muta-
tion rate   in animals   could   be  caused   by  more   mutagenic     envionment,     low  eﬃgacy
mutation    repair.   Ultimately    this might    be  caused    by  selection   or drift.  Muller’s
ratchet  suggests   that  continued   high  mutation     rate  without   recombination    will  lead
to a degradation    of phenotype    and   eventual   extinction   (?).  Note   that DNA    repair  is
handled   by  nuclear  genome    (?).
    Indirect  estimates    of mutationrate     from   substitution    at neutral   sites/ dn/ds   or
genome    divergence   have  been   made   in  many    species  (see  Smith,   2015  for a review).
If a sequence   is not  under   any  selection  - its sub  rate  is equal   to the  mutation   rate.


Introduction                                                                                         7

BUT   diﬃcult   to  tell whether    a sequence    is under   selection  due  to regulation   but  ad-
jacent/ﬂanking    eﬀects.    Lots   of selection    occurs  at  synonymous     sites.  Furthermore
synonymous     sites may    actually   have   a  higher  mutation    rate due   to GC   content   dif-
ferences (?).  Also  divergence     based  estimates    assume   that  only  a single mutation    has
occured  at  a given   site  - in  cases  where    mult  mutations     have  occured   the  estimate
is biased downwards.       Although    this  problem    is addressed    in Nabholz   et  al. by  sub-
dividing  into  smaller   taxonomic     groups.     A  beneﬁt   of  this method    however    is that
any  available sequencing     data   can  be  used  so  lots of comparisons    can  be  made   easily.
(as opposed    to  MA    experiments     which    require   a much    bigger  commitment).       Also
intraspeciﬁc  polymorphism        can  be mistaken     for interspeciﬁc   variation  (?). These   ap-
proaches  are  still useful   but  important     to remember     that  they  provide   only  a  lower
bound.
    In mutation    accumulation      experiments,    selection  is reduced   by  repeatedly   bottle-
necking  a population     so that   only  most   severe  (lethal/sterile)  mutations    are ignored.
Estimates   of mutation    rate  in humans     are  10 fold higher   in direct estimates   (pedigree
studies) than   in  divergence    based   estimates    (suggesting   weak   selection)  (?).  Gener-
ally direct estimates    using   mutation    accumulation     or parent-oﬀspring     sequencing   are
more  accurate  in  estimating    per generation    mutation    rate. Direct  estimates  of  mtDNA
mutation   rate have   been   made   in Caenorhabditis      elegans  (?), Caenorhabditis     briggsae
(?)  Drosophila   melanogaster      (?),  Daphnia     pulex  (?),  Saccharomyces     cerevisiae   (?),
Dictyostelium    discoideum     (?),  Paramecium       tetraurelia  (?)  and   Pristionchus    paciﬁ-
cus  (?). A  comparison      of  direct  and   indirect  mutation    rate  estimates   with  nuclear
mutation   rates is presented     in Table   x. These   estimates   are consistent   in ﬁnding   that
the mitochondrial     mutation     rate is approximately      10-100x   higher  than  the  mutation
rate of the  nuclear   genome     (check  if true).   MA   experiments     lead to  a dominance     of
intracellular selection   which    leads  to  increased   replication  but  lack  of respiration  (?)
Note  that  this also  occurs   in  nuclear   estimates   so more   related  to methodology      than
speciﬁc  organelle   phenomenon.        Clearly   this  is a very   small  sampling   of  eukaryotic
diversity so the  true  patterns    of mitochondrial    mutation    rate  remain  to be  elucidated.
Increased  mutation     rate is a  trait shared   between    organelles  in general  (?).  This  sug-
gests that there   is some   evolutionary    or  selective factor  unrelated   to the  machinery    of
mutation   repair.  Either   intracellular   is more   mutagenic    or  there is a beneﬁt   in  being
more  variable.
    High  variability  in estimates   at  every  taxonomic    level suggests  that  both  mechanis-
tic and evolutionary     processes   involved.    Although    mtDNA     damage    repair is encoded
by nucleus,  diﬀerences    still exist in  repair  between   nuclear   and  mitochondrial    genome

(?). Interestingly,  certain key  members    of the  mtDNA     replication  system   are derived
from viral  genes.  The   ﬁrst observation   of  this found   that yeast  mitochondrial    RNA
polymerase   is  most  closely  related  to genes   from   bacteriphage    (?)   This  was later
extended  to  diverse  eukaryotic  lineages  (?). It is now   established  that  many   proteins
involved in  mitochondrial   replication  are  of bacteriophage    origin suggesting   a simula-
neous  endosymbiontic     event  (?). Our  understanding     of diﬀerences    in the replication
and repair  machinery    between    species is currently   very  limited.  Right   now  we have
only detected   very  obvious  alterations:  for  example   yeast  has  mutS    which  functions
in mitochondrial    mismatch    repair  but animals    dont  (?).  It is likely that  many   ﬁne
grained alterations  in these  processes  could  lead to  the diﬀerences  in  mtDNA    mutation
rate which  we   see.
   An   attractive/intuitive   evolutionary    explanation    for this  high  mutation    rate is
that the mitochondria’s     role in the  OXPHOS      system   leads  to more    mutations  (??).
This makes   intuitive sense  since reactive  oxygen   species are given  oﬀ  during  OXPHOS
which  are  known   mutagens.     Harsh   blow  against   this theory   is that  proteobacteria
related to  mitochondria    with   similar ROS    production    dont  have   elevated  mutation
(see Raven,  2015).   However   evidence   has  not been   supportive   (?)
   ALternatively     mutation   rate  may   be  related   to generation    time.   Species  with
shorter generation   time   will have  more   rounds   of replication  in  a given  time  period
(??)
   Selection   generally  opposes   mutation   but  the  strength  of selection  varies depend-
ing on environment.     Longevity    hypothesis   suggests   that selection   on  mitochondrial
mutation  is stronger   in longer  lived organisms    (?).

Heteroplasmy

Due  to  the  many    mtDNA     copies  per  cell, in  order  to  achieve   ﬁxation   mutations
must  spread  to  encompass   all mtDNA     in the  cell. Heteroplasmy    is the  coexistence of
multiple mtDNA      genotypes   in a given  cell.
